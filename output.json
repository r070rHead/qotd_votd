A voice of mercy from heaven; and a voice of truth out of the earth; glad tidings for the dead; a voice of gladness for the living and the dead; glad tidings of great joy. How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of those that bring glad tidings of good things, and that say unto Zion: Behold, thy God reigneth! As the dews of Carmel, so shall the knowledge of God descend upon them!\nDoctrine and Covenants 128:19\nQuote of the Day\n\"We will weather the storms, and we will make it home, enduring to the end and rejoicing to the end.\"\nElder Sergio R. Vargas | 1 Apr 2025General Conference",
