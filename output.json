And ye rivers, and brooks, and rills, flow down with gladness. Let the woods and all the trees of the field praise the Lord; and ye solid rocks weep for joy! And let the sun, moon, and the morning stars sing together, and let all the sons of God shout for joy! And let the eternal creations declare his name forever and ever! And again I say, how glorious is the voice we hear from heaven, proclaiming in our ears, glory, and salvation, and honor, and immortality, and eternal life; kingdoms, principalities, and powers!\nDoctrine and Covenants 128:23\nQuote of the Day\n\"When we consecrate our meager but best effort, God magnifies it. When we sacrifice for Christ, He sanctifies us.\"\nElder Steven D. Shumway | 1 Apr 2025General Conference",
